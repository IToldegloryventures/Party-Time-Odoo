    <!-- PTT Operational Dashboard - Search Filters -->
    <!-- 
        NOTE: All pre-configured ir.filters records have been REMOVED.
        
        REASON: The ir.filters model changed in Odoo 19:
        - 'user_id' field no longer exists (was used for filter ownership)
        - Complex domain expressions caused compatibility issues
        
        Users can create their own saved filters through:
        Settings > Technical > User Interface > Filters
        
        Or via the search bar in any list view:
        1. Set your filters
        2. Click "Favorites" dropdown
        3. Click "Save current search"
    -->

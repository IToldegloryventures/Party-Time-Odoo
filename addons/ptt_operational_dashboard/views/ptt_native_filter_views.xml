        NOTE: All search view inheritance records have been REMOVED.
        
        REASON: External XML IDs for search views vary between Odoo versions/editions
        and were causing deployment failures on Odoo.sh:
        - sale.view_sale_order_search (doesn't exist)
        - account.view_invoice_filter (doesn't exist)
        - crm.view_crm_case_opportunities_filter (may not exist)
        - project.view_project_project_filter (may not exist)
        - project.view_task_search_form (may not exist)
        
        Odoo's native search views already provide:
        - Quote status filters
        - Date grouping
        - Priority filters
        - Probability filters
        - Overdue invoice filters
        
        Custom filters can be added via Settings > Technical > User Interface > Filters
        without requiring code changes.

    <!-- 
        Cleanup unwanted CRM stages that should not exist.
        This removes/folds stages that are duplicates or not part of our workflow.
        
        Stages to delete/fold:
        - "Qualified" (we use "Qualification" instead)
        - "Quote Sent" (we use "Proposal Sent" instead)
        - "Approval" (not in our workflow)
        - "Execution" (not in our workflow, execution happens in projects)
        - "New" (we rename it to "Intake", but if it still exists, fold it)
    -->
    
    <!-- Delete unwanted stages by name (they will be deleted on module update) -->
    <!-- Note: We can't directly delete via XML, so we'll fold them and mark for manual cleanup -->

        PTT Project Task Form View Extension - DISABLED
        
        This view is DISABLED (active=False) because:
        1. The original button referenced action_view_project which doesn't exist
        2. Empty xpaths with position="attributes" are INVALID in Odoo 19
        
        The view is kept to maintain the XML ID but won't be loaded.
        If you need to extend project.task in the future, set active=True
        and add proper xpaths with actual content.
